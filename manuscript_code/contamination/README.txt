Redo Contamination: 

Halomonas was most abundant, and was clearly a contaminant. 
So dataset was assessed for contaminant influence. 
Result is removing 4 otus with lots of influence. 
Assessment was done in these scripts, and contamination removal is duplicated
in cleanup scripts in analysis folder.
