This directory gives a quick glance at conditions in the experimental chamber. 
We used two different air flow rates, 1 ACH and 3 ACH. 
Each person was allowed to dictate their own temp, and that influenced relative humidity. 

Both of these datasets are plotted to ensure that the conditions were as we planned.
